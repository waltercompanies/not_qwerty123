defmodule NotQwerty123.PasswordStrength do
  @moduledoc """
  Module to check password strength.

  This module does not provide a password strength meter. Instead, it
  simply rejects passwords that are considered too weak. Depending on
  the nature of your application, a solid front end solution to password
  checking, such as [this Dropbox implementation](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn)
  might be a better idea.

  ## Password strength

  In simple terms, password strength depends on how long a password is
  and how easy it is to guess it. In most cases, passwords should be at
  least 8 characters long, and they should not be similar to common
  passwords, like `password` or `qwerty123`, or consist of repeated
  characters, like `abcabcabcabc`. Dictionary words, common names
  and user-specific words (company name, address, etc.) should also
  be avoided.

  ## Further information

  The [NIST password guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html).

  The [Comeonin wiki](https://github.com/elixircnx/comeonin/wiki)
  also has links to further information about password-related issues.

  Check the strength of the password.

  It returns `{:ok, password}` or `{:error, message}`.

  The password is checked to make sure that it is not too short, that
  it does not consist of repeated characters (e.g. 'abcabcabcabc') and
  that it is not similar to any word in the common password list.

  See the documentation for `NotQwerty123.WordlistManager` for
  information about customizing the common password list.

  ## Options

  There is only one option:

    * `:min_length` - minimum allowable length of the password
      * default is `8`
